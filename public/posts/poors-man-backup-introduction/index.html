I need a very low-cost but reliable backup routine, which I’ve been neglecting for too long.
I want to follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: 3 copies of my data, 2 different storage media, 1 off-site storage.
I calculated my storage requirements based on real usage.
My starting setup: 1 Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB RAM), 1 × 256GB SSD, 1 × 1TB USB HDD, and AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Introduction 🔗I have been using cloud storage systems as my main way to sync and backup data for the past 10 years (at least). Yes, I know, cloud storage like OneDrive, Goole Drive, Dropbox, etc. are not meant to be used as backup solutions, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeding big tech monsters with more data. Especially personal data.">

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction <a href="#introduction" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I have been using cloud storage systems as my main way to sync and <strong>backup</strong> data for the past 10 years (at least). Yes, I know, cloud storage like OneDrive, Goole Drive, Dropbox, etc. are not meant to be used as backup solutions, and I shouldn&rsquo;t be feeding big tech monsters with more data. Especially personal data.</p>
<p>So, I decided to break the inertia and set up my own backup solution. It won&rsquo;t be perfect, but it will be simple, cheap, useful and the most important: fun to build.</p>
<p>This is the first post of a series where I intend to share my quest to establish a minimal, reliable solution to streamline my backup routine.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-back-up">What do I need to back up? <a href="#what-do-i-need-to-back-up" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>First, we need to understand my reality and what I do with my data. First of all, as a software engineer, I have&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A bunch of personal projects</strong>: most of them unfinished, but full of useful snippets and ideas.</li>
<li><strong>One endless library of books</strong>: I haven’t read 1/3 of them, but they are precious to me.</li>
<li><strong>Personal documents</strong>: digital copies of personal documents that I often use while dealing with my daily life problems and bureaucracy.</li>
<li><strong>Photos &amp; Videos</strong>: the usual phone clutter that holds special moments of our lifes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can categorize this data by availability into 2 sets:</p>
<h3 id="data-that-i-may-need-anywhere">Data that I (may) need anywhere. <a href="#data-that-i-may-need-anywhere" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Personal documents, photos, and videos. I want quick access to these, even outside home, and they’re already synced across devices via my cloud provider.</p>
<h3 id="data-i-only-need-at-home">Data I only need at home <a href="#data-i-only-need-at-home" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><p>Projects, books, notes. These don’t need to be synced to my phone or tablet, and in fact, syncing code to cloud folders has caused me issues before.</p>
<p>Great! Based on that, I can say that I mainly need <strong>two storage spaces</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A network-shared folder for data that doesn&rsquo;t belong in the cloud.</li>
<li>A cold storage area for copies of everything, including what I pull down from the cloud.</li>
</ol>

</p></p>
<h2 id="the-3-2-1-backup-rule">The 3-2-1 backup rule <a href="#the-3-2-1-backup-rule" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>The classic principle for reliable backups:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>3 copies of data</strong> — the original plus two backups.</li>
<li><strong>2 different media types</strong> — not all eggs in one basket.</li>
<li><strong>1 off-site copy</strong> — in case of fire, theft, or disaster.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how I’m mapping it:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Rule</th>
          <th>Data Synced Across Devices</th>
          <th>Other Data</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>3 copies</td>
          <td>Cloud Storage, NAS Drive, Local Backup Media</td>
          <td>Laptop Drive, NAS Drive, Local Backup Media</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>2 different media</td>
          <td>Local Backup Media, AWS S3</td>
          <td>Local Backup Media, AWS S3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>1 off-site</td>
          <td>AWS S3</td>
          <td>AWS S3</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>For off-site, I’m using <strong>AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive</strong>. Cheap, reliable, and fits my low-cost goal.</p>
<h2 id="how-often">How often? <a href="#how-often" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>Frequency is always a trade-off between cost and recoverability. My routine looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I work 9–6, and outside that I code, study, or write.</li>
<li>Losing 6 hours of data would be unpleasant, but survivable.</li>
<li>My dataset is ~17GB compressed, with ~100MB changes every 6 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this, I chose:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 full backup monthly</strong> (17GB).</li>
<li><strong>1 differential backup every 6 hours</strong> (~12GB total/month).</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s ~30GB/month. Add 20% margin → <strong>~36GB/month</strong>.<br>
A 500GB disk holds over 12 months, which is plenty.</p>

</p></p>
<h2 id="hardware-setup">Hardware setup <a href="#hardware-setup" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>I am planning to initially use components that I already have at home:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi 4B (2GB RAM)</strong> → runs the automation.</li>
<li><strong>256GB NVMe SSD (USB3 hat)</strong> → network-shared folder + cloud sync mirror.</li>
<li><strong>1TB USB HDD</strong> → backup destination. Low-cost, flexible. (Eventually I’ll upgrade to a dock with proper cooling and reliability.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software-stack">Software stack <a href="#software-stack" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Component</th>
          <th>Purpose</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Raspberry OS Lite</td>
          <td>Operating system</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>SSH</td>
          <td>Remote access</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>UFW</td>
          <td>Firewall</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>OneDrive Client for Linux</td>
          <td>Pull data from OneDrive</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>TAR + GZIP</td>
          <td>Archive + compress</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>OpenSSL</td>
          <td>Encrypt before upload</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>AWS CLI</td>
          <td>Upload to S3</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>On top of that, I’ll harden access and automate as much as possible.</p>
<h2 id="off-site-storage-cost">Off-site storage cost <a href="#off-site-storage-cost" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>At the time of writing, AWS S3 Glacier Deep Archive costs <strong>$0.00099/GB/month</strong>. With I quick and easy math we can see how a bargain it will be:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Storage Requirement: ~ 36GB / * 12 months ~ 432GB for one year of backup retentnion
Monthly Cost: USD 0.00099 per GB per month * 432 GB (after 12 months of backup) = USD 0.43 per month
Yearly Cost: USD 0.43 * 12 months = USD 5.16
</code></pre><p>For less than <strong>$6/year</strong>, I can have a reliable, long-term off-site storage for my humble backup.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up <a href="#wrapping-up" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>With ~36GB/month of backups, a Raspberry Pi, and some spare drives, I can implement a <strong>3-2-1 strategy</strong> that’s cheap, reliable, and good enough for a regular person like me.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll share the configuration details — but I won’t just copy-paste one of the 2,000 Raspberry Pi tutorials out there. Expect something practical and personal.</p>
